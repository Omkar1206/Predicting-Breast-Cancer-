# Predicting-Breast-Cancer-
In this notebook I have tried to analyse the breast cancer data. 

You can find this data above.

Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.

Currently, there are more than 3 million women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States.

<h4>It is necessary that this cancer is detected at the earliest stage.</h4>
<h4>After a lot of feature engineering and analysis I have a test accuracy of 97% and training accuracy of 95%</h4>
<h4>Please suggest me your insights or the things you think I can improve.</h4>
